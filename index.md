## About Me

I am a graduate student in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Amsterdam, where I also completed my bachelor degrees in Artificial Intelligence (cum laude) and Information Science.
My interests include (but are not limited to) geometry, representation learning and generative models.
Feel free to reach out to me if you want to talk about research!
