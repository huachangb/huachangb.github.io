## About Me

I am currently a graduate student in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Amsterdam, where I also completed my bachelor degrees in Artificial Intelligence (cum laude) and Information Science.
My interests include (but are not limited to) geometry, representation learning and foundation models.


## Research Interests

- **Machine Learning:** Representation Learning, Foundation Models
- More interests will be added in the near future.


## Updates
- **[Feb. 2025]** arXiv preprint on 'Keep your distance: learning dispersed embeddings on S_m' is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08231)
- **[Sep. 2024]** Workshop paper on 'counterfactual risk minimization' accepted at CONSEQUENCES@RecSys
- **[Jul. 2024]** Workshop paper on 'hyperspherical embedding dispersion' accepted at GRaM@ICML
