I am an [ELLIS](https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/ellis/) honours student in Artificial Intelligence at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en), where I also completed my bachelor degrees in Artificial Intelligence (cum laude) and Information Science.
My interests include (but are not limited to) geometry, representation learning and generative models.
